*( The file is too big, need to view raw. Sorry about that)*

**description：**

* I chose that because, although the lines are basic, the design is quite attractive. 
It also makes effective use of the knowledge learned during the class.



### The inspiration 2

*( The file is too big, need to view raw. Sorry about that)*

**description：**

* My idea is that the constantly running man rushes through the above mentioned grid in turn, 
and when the man rushes through the grib, the grid breaks into a hole



# 2. here is my Coding Exploration

### The exploration 1

**coding discussion：**

* Simulation Setup:

  - initializes a simulation with nodes and links

* Representation: 

  - defines classes for nodes and links
  - specifying properties

* Simulation Loop:

  - use draw() function manages the simulation loop
  - updating node positions

* User Interaction:

  - detects mouse movements and cuts links accordingly

```


### The exploration 2

**coding discussion：**

* Loading Data and Images:

  - containing data about frames and an image file (character.png) in the sheet

* Setup Function:

  - add each frame to array called animation

* Creating Objects:

  - Creates multiple instances and initializes
  - specifying positions and speed

* Drawing Function:

  - Use draw() function to render each frame of the animated
